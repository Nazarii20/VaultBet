      </p>

      <ul className="p-1">
        <li>
          It is unlawful to make use of the Services with funds which consist of
          the proceeds of criminal activities;

        If you place a wager on a fixture that never occurs, your wager will
        automatically be refunded to you by the Smart Contract in line with the
        below scenarios.
      </p>

      <ul className="p-1">
        <li>
          In the event you place a bet on a match that is postponed, then all
          bets will stand until the match result is fully determined.

        <li>
          In the event you place a bet on a match that is cancelled, the funds
          are automatically remitted back to you by the smart contract.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="p-1">
        All match markets are based on the result found by the data oracle at
        the end of play unless otherwise stated. This includes any added injury
        or stoppage time and also includes extra-time, time allocated for a
        penalty shootout or golden goal. Bets on any match that finishes before
        the completion of play, unless otherwise stated, will be void; except
        for those bets the outcome of which has already been determined at the
        time the game finishes. The market must be fully determined for bets to
        stand. Settlement of the Smart Contracts will occur based upon what the
        data oracle finds as truth.
      </p>
      <p className="p-1">
        Should any match be played prior to the date or kick-off time denoted,
        then all bets will stand until the match result is fully determined.
      </p>
      <p className="p-1">
        If a match is interrupted but subsequently resumed (from the point in
        the match at which it was interrupted), then all bets will stand until
        the match result is fully determined. If a match is interrupted for any
        reason, and is replayed in full (with the clock starting from 00:00),
        this will be treated as cancelled and bets on the original fixture will
        be void. If a match venue is changed (other than to the away team&apos;s
        ground) then bets already placed will stand.
